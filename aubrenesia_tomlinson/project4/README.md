# PROJECT 4 - Bash Scripts

This project focuses on programming a Scala program on a JVM that reads data from this website: "https://chamspage.blogspot.com/" and dockerizes it to answer two questions, using a shell script.

## Questions

The two questions I wanted my program to ask were "what is the average age of victims in 2025?" and "how many of the cases in 2025 had surveillance cameras present?"

## Usage


```bash
./run.sh

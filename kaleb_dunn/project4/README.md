# Project 4: Baltimore Homicide Data Analysis in (Scala) 

## Overview
This project analyzes Baltimore City homicide data (2023â€“2025) from [Cham's Page](https://chamspage.blogspot.com/) to provide actionable insights for the Mayor's office and Police Department.  

It addresses two main questions:  
1. **District Clearance Rate Analysis:** Which police districts are most effective at closing homicide cases?  
2. **Police Camera Effectiveness Analysis:** Do homicides near surveillance cameras get solved at higher rates, and should more cameras be installed?

---

## Key Findings (Example Output)
**District Clearance Rates:**  
- Eastern: 62.2% (best performing)  
- Western: 20.2% (needs attention)  
- City average: 43.4%  

**Camera Effectiveness:**  
- Homicides near cameras: 46.8% clearance  
- Homicides away from cameras: 38.4% clearance  
- 38.5% of homicides occur near cameras  
- Recommendation: Expand camera coverage in high-crime areas

# Project 6 â€” Baltimore Homicide Analysis (Go)

Go re-implementation of the earlier Scala project. Reads `data.csv` and answers:

1) How many homicide victims in 2025 were killed at or near their home?  
2) What percentage of 2025 homicide victims were under 25 years old?

## Run
```bash
./run.sh                 # prints to terminal (stdout)
./run.sh --output=csv    # writes output.csv
./run.sh --output=json   # writes output.json

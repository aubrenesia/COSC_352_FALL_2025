# Project 5 – Multi-Format Crime Data Output

## 📖 Overview
This project extends **Project 4** by allowing the program to output its results in three different formats:

1. **stdout** – default (prints formatted text to the terminal)  
2. **csv** – writes results to `output.csv` in comma-separated format  
3. **json** – writes results to `output.json` in JSON array format  

The output format is chosen using a flag passed to the `run.sh` script.
